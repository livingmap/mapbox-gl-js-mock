A maybe-some-day-fully-featured mock for mapbox-gl-js

Work on this is on a need come basis. As we find ourselves writing tests for Mapbox Studio and mapbox maintained mapbox-gl extensions we make this better.
If you have a feature in mapbox-gl-js that you want supported here, please feel free to create an issue or open a PR.


###Â NOTE:

please commit this WITH a builded version.
